This package includes R functions to the most frequently used three-dimensional fixed effects panel data models and the appropriate Within estimators based on

 * László Balázsi, László Mátyás and Tom Wansbeek (2014): [The Estimation of Multi-dimensional Fixed Effects Panel Data Models](http://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:ceu:econwp:2014_1). No 2014_1, CEU Working Papers, Department of Economics, Central European University.

The original goal of this package is to provide a way to do all the required transformations and estimates for reasonable large datasets on commodity hardware in reasonable time. The algorithms were tested on a laptop with 8 Gb of RAM for 180 x 180 x 46 matrices.
